# Firmware for EnviTronics Lab DIY Sensor Interfaces
This repository holds Arduino sketches that will allow for reading EnviTronics Lab sensors. The sensors are as the following:

1) [HITA E0 EC/TDS Soil & rockwool sensor](https://www.envitronicslab.com/hita-e0)
2) [APAS T1 soil & rockwool moisture sensor](https://www.envitronicslab.com/apas-t1)


The firmware is capable of automatically detecting sensors connected to Arduino digital pins, so it works even if you have only one sensor. You will also be able to read arduino serial number and sensor 64-bit ID.

You can also use the sketch to send sensor data over Bluetooth LE to your smartphone using our [open-source mobile app](https://github.com/envitronicslab/Android_App_DIY).


# Breadboard, Schematic and PCB Design
In this repository, you will also find complete designs (in [fritzing](https://fritzing.org/)) for two types of sensor interface.
